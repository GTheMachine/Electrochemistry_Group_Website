Set up style and structure similar to Landon's website on GitHub
https://pokekid101.github.io/
https://github.com/PokeKid101/PokeKid101.github.io

GitHub is a good way to have a basic static website and can be updated easily
However, GitHub doesn't support server-side programs or databases
(Need to establish a webserver for server-side and database support)
